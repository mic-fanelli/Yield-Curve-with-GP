# Yield-Curve-with-GP
Pet application of Gaussian Process and Deep Gaussian Process Regressions to yield curve modelling.
Planning to add more comparisons with more conventional models such as bootstrapping techniques, interpolations, ecc.
Looking for advice on DGP since it does not seem to work properly.
